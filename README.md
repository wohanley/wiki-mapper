wiki-mapper
===========

Parses a standard Wikipedia list article, presuming a list of locations, and adds those locations to a KML map file. For example, here's a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zFyW2_i17M2U.k_pNylFQdB8w&msa=0&ie=UTF8&t=m&source=embed&ll=14.944785,12.65625&spn=92.254439,271.456295 "Berlin Wall segments") of all the known [segments of the Berlin Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berlin_Wall_segments "Wikipedia article listing Berlin Wall segments").

Google Maps
-----------

Importing KML files into Google Maps generally doesn't work all that well. 
If you want to do such a thing (and why not!), it works much more reliably
to host your KML somewhere else and give Google Maps the URL (this is the
second option in the import dialog). If you don't have a web hosting
service readily available, you must be an 18th century peasant and this is
not going to work for you. Or you can use Google Sites, whatever.
